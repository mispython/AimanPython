LALWEIRC Processing (Stub)

This is a stub script representing the LALWEIRC processing program.
Replace this with the actual LALWEIRC conversion when available.

The actual LALWEIRC program should:
- Read EIR (Effective Interest Rate) data from the input/ directory
- Calculate and process EIR-related metrics
- Write outputs to the output/ directory
