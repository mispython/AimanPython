LALWPBBC Processing (Stub)

This is a stub script representing the LALWPBBC processing program.
Replace this with the actual LALWPBBC conversion when available.

The actual LALWPBBC program should:
- Read input data from the input/ directory
- Process loan and advance data
- Write outputs to the output/ directory
